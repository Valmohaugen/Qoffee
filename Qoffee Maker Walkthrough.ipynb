    "Our goal is to obtain 12 different coffee orders utilizing quantum circuits on IBM's Quantum Composer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 different types of coffee that can be made with this activity and are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of coffee is associated with a different qubit state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we obtain different states (coffee types) is by applying different gates. We can read which state we get as a graph of probabilities to determine which which coffee is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for example, we want a viennese melange, there must be a probability of 100% for the state $\\ket{110}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are orders involving specific directions, then there will have to be different probabilities for the corresponding states. For example, if we want a tea and a viennese melange, then we would have a 50% probability for both $\\ket{000}$ and $\\ket{110}$."
